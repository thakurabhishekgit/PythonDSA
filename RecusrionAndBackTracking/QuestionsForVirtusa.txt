‚úÖ Foundational Problems (Build Recursion Thinking)
Factorial / Fibonacci

Simple base-case identification and recursion tracing.

Power Function / Exponentiation

Recursion with optimized approach (divide and conquer).

Print All Subsequences of a String/Array

Subset generation using include/exclude pattern.

Sum of Subsets / Subset Sums

Classic problem for recursion + decision trees.




üîÅ Backtracking Essentials
Rat in a Maze

2D movement with constraints (recursion + visited matrix).

N-Queens Problem

Place N queens safely; build intuition for row-by-row constraints.

Sudoku Solver

Recursive trial and error with early pruning.

Word Search in Grid

DFS + Backtracking to find word in 2D board.

Generate Balanced Parentheses

Maintain open/close counts; classic for Virtusa-style questions.

Permutations / Combinations

With and without duplicates (LC: Permutations I & II).





üöÄ Intermediate to Power Coder Level
Palindrome Partitioning

Partition string into all palindromic substrings (recursion + backtracking).

Combination Sum I & II

Return all combinations of numbers that sum to target.

Letter Combinations of a Phone Number

Mapping digits to letters (recursion tree traversal).

Restore IP Addresses

Try placing dots at valid positions (string + recursion).

Knight‚Äôs Tour Problem / Hamiltonian Path

Classic grid movement with deep recursion.

üß† Hard + Interview-Level (Optional for Virtusa, but great prep)
Tiling Problem / Ways to Place Tiles

Recursive state representation.

Expression Add Operators

Backtracking + string + expression evaluation.

Maximum Unique Path with Backtracking

DFS on grid with constraints.
