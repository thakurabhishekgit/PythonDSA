The owner and sole employee, Klyde Kronecker, keeps track of how many digits of each type he has used by maintaining an inventory book. For instance, if he has just made a sign containing the telephone number \"5553141\", he'll write down the number \"5553141\" in one column of his book, and in the next column he'll list how many of each digit he used: two 1s, one 3, one 4, and three 5s. (Digits that don't get used don't appear in the inventory.) He writes the inventory in condensed form, like this: \"21131435\".\n",

He calls this an example of a \"self-inventorying number\", and now he wants to find out which numbers are self-inventorying, or lead to a self-inventorying number through iterated application of the inventorying operation described below.

For instance, to compute the inventory of 5553141 we set c1 = 2, d1 = 1, c2 = 1, d2 = 3, etc., giving 21131435. The number 1000000000000 has inventory 12011 (\"twelve 0s, one 1\").\n",
