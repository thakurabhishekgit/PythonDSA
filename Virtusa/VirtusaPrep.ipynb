    "\n",
    "1. **Choose 5 from each** category and practice them with varying complexity.\n",
    "2. **Focus on patterns**, not memorization—like state transitions in DP or pruning in backtracking.\n",
    "3. **Time-box your tries**—aim to solve 4 out of 5 comfortably under 150 minutes in total.\n",
    "4. **After coding practice**, simulate 1–2 “explain-only” questions like Virtusa uses. For example, explain BFS on a given graph or steps in the Word Break DP without writing full code.\n",

    "\n",
    "Virtusa Stage 2 – Key Practice Problems\n",
    "Dynamic Programming (DP) Problems\n",
    "\n",
    "Longest Increasing Subsequence (LIS) – Given an integer array, find the length of the longest strictly increasing subsequence (i.e. a subsequence of elements in increasing order)\n",
    "geeksforgeeks.org\n",
    ". (Medium difficulty; common in Virtusa tests.)\n",
    "\n",
    "0/1 Knapsack – Given n items with weights and profits and a knapsack capacity W, select items to maximize total profit without exceeding weight W\n",
    "geeksforgeeks.org\n",
    ". (Classic DP for optimal subset selection.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Longest Common Subsequence (LCS) – Given two strings, find the length of their longest common subsequence (delete characters to match sequences)\n",
    "geeksforgeeks.org\n",
    ". (Frequent DP pattern; Virtusa often asks LCS/LIS variants.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Edit Distance – Given two strings s1 and s2, compute the minimum number of insert/delete/replace operations to convert s1 into s2\n",
    "geeksforgeeks.org\n",
    ". (Standard DP problem, tests string DP skills.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Coin Change (Minimum Coins) – Given coin denominations and a target sum, find the minimum number of coins required to form that sum (or report impossible)\n",
    "geeksforgeeks.org\n",
    ". (Another classic DP on arrays; Virtusa may phrase it as making change.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Subset Sum – Given an array of non-negative integers and a target sum, determine if any subset of the array sums to that value\n",
    "geeksforgeeks.org\n",
    ". (DP on subsets; often appears in coding rounds.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Backtracking Problems\n",
    "\n",
    "N-Queens – Place N queens on an N×N chessboard so that no two queens attack each other\n",
    "geeksforgeeks.org\n",
    ". Output one valid arrangement (or count all solutions). (Known hard problem; Virtusa Stage-2 has explicitly asked N‑Queens backtracking.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Sudoku Solver – Fill a 9×9 grid so each row, column, and 3×3 block contains the digits 1–9 exactly once\n",
    "geeksforgeeks.org\n",
    ". Given a partially filled Sudoku, complete it using backtracking. (Virtusa-style hard problem; often cited in interviews.)\n",
    "\n",
    "String Permutations – Generate all permutations of a given string (or array) using backtracking\n",
    "geeksforgeeks.org\n",
    ". For example, given \"ABC\", produce \"ABC\",\"ACB\",\"BAC\",…. (Fundamental backtracking example; tests recursive generation.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Graph M‑Coloring – Given an undirected graph and integer m, determine if the vertices can be colored with ≤ m colors so no adjacent vertices share a color. This uses backtracking to try color assignments. (Common backtracking/graph question in Virtusa power-coding rounds.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Rat in a Maze – Given an n×n grid (with obstacles), find a path for a rat from (0,0) to (n-1,n-1) moving only right/down. Use backtracking to explore possible paths. (Classic maze/backtracking problem; good practice for Virtusa recursion skills.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Graph Problems\n",
    "\n",
    "Dijkstra’s Shortest Path – Given a weighted graph (no negative edges) and a source vertex, compute shortest-path distances from the source to all other vertices\n",
    "geeksforgeeks.org\n",
    ". (Virtusa has featured weighted-graph path problems like Dijkstra’s.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) – Given a connected weighted graph, find a spanning tree of minimum total edge weight (e.g. using Prim’s or Kruskal’s algorithm). Output the total weight or the edges of the MST. (MST problems (Prim/Kruskal) often appear in coding rounds.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Number of Islands (Connected Components) – Given a 2D grid of land/water, count the number of islands (connected regions)\n",
    "geeksforgeeks.org\n",
    ". Equivalently, find the number of connected components in a graph. (Tests graph traversal (DFS/BFS) on grids; Virtusa may ask similar component-count problems.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Cycle Detection in Graph – Determine if a directed or undirected graph contains a cycle (using DFS or topological sort). For a directed graph, one can use DFS with recursion stack or Kahn’s algorithm to detect a cycle. (A common graph-checking question; often asked under graph fundamentals.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Topological Sort (DAG) – Given a directed acyclic graph (DAG), find a topological ordering of its vertices. If the graph contains a cycle (not a DAG), report that. (Standard graph problem; tests understanding of DFS or Kahn’s BFS.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Graph Coloring – (Also solvable via backtracking.) Check if a graph can be colored with a given number of colors so that no adjacent nodes share a color. (Often framed as an “m-coloring” backtracking/graph problem.)"
