    "## Dynamic Programming (DP) — 5 Key Problems\n",
    "\n",
    "These are some of the most frequently asked DP questions in interviews:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Longest Common Subsequence (LCS)**\n",
    "   Find the length (or sequence) common to two strings. Great for understanding 2D DP tables.\n",
    "   ([GeeksforGeeks][1])\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Longest Increasing Subsequence (LIS)**\n",
    "   Determine the length of the longest increasing subsequence in an array.\n",
    "   ([GeeksforGeeks][1])\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **0/1 Knapsack Problem**\n",
    "   Maximize value with weight constraint—classic optimization DP.\n",
    "   ([GeeksforGeeks][1])\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Coin Change Problem** (count ways or find minimum coins)\n",
    "   Use DP to handle combinations or min coin counts for given denominations.\n",
    "   ([GeeksforGeeks][1])\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Word Break / Edit Distance / Palindrome Partitioning**\n",
    "   Recognizing substrings, modifying strings with minimal edits, or slicing palindromes—excellent for intermediate DP practice.\n",

    "Here are some high-yield backtracking questions that interviewers often ask:\n",

    "1. **Rat in a Maze** — navigate through a matrix with recursion and backtracking.\n",
    "   ([GeeksforGeeks][2])\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Print All Permutations of a String** — generate all orderings via recursion.\n",
    "   ([GeeksforGeeks][2])\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Sudoku Solver** — use backtracking to fill in valid numbers.\n",
    "   ([GeeksforGeeks][2])\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **N-Queens Problem** — place N queens on a board without conflicts.\n",
    "   ([GeeksforGeeks][2])\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Subset Sum / Palindromic Partitioning / Word Break**\n",

    "\n",
    "Graph problems often show up in coding rounds. Here are some common themes and problem types:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Breadth-First Search (BFS)** — e.g., “Rotting Oranges” spread simulation, shortest path in unweighted graphs.\n",
    "   ([techinterviewhandbook.org][3])\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Clone Graph** — properly replicate a graph structure with correct references.\n",
    "   ([techinterviewhandbook.org][3])\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Number of Connected Components** — count components in an undirected graph.\n",
    "   ([techinterviewhandbook.org][3])\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Topological Sorting / Course Schedule** — manage dependencies in DAGs.\n",
    "   ([techinterviewhandbook.org][3])\n",

    "### Next Steps for You\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Choose 5 from each** category and practice them with varying complexity.\n",
    "2. **Focus on patterns**, not memorization—like state transitions in DP or pruning in backtracking.\n",
    "3. **Time-box your tries**—aim to solve 4 out of 5 comfortably under 150 minutes in total.\n",
    "4. **After coding practice**, simulate 1–2 “explain-only” questions like Virtusa uses. For example, explain BFS on a given graph or steps in the Word Break DP without writing full code.\n",
